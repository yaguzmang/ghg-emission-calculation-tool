## Import and export data

To save time from manually typing in data, the project comes with a basic starting point based on the [GHG qantification model spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uVMZRZjQ2LFPcwRgRoiAyaYsQhJnL8Ey/edit).

### `import`

Import the baseline content from version control.

```
npm run import
```

**Warning!** The `import` command overwrites your database.

### `export`

Export your current database content to version control.

```
npm run export
```
